                    In my semesters at Iowa State University, I’ve learned lots of very important skills about how to be an engineer. 
                    All my different classes have taught me both technical and soft skills that I’ve gotten to use in internships, 
                    and hopefully in a full-time job. Classes like Software Development Practices (COM S 309), Computer Graphics Processing and Architecture (CPRE 480),
                    and Senior Design (CPRE 491) have not only taught me the corresponding technical skills, but also how to work with a team on a technical project.
                    While the pandemic was generally not a good thing, having to learn remotely meant that myself and other engineering students
                    were forced to find ways to work and learn while remote. Tools like Discord and VSCode’s Live Share extension made communication 
                    and collaborative working manageable in the semesters we spent apart. Even now that we’re back to mostly in-person classes, those same tools improve how we work. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to accomplish many of the tasks required for the projects in my engineering classes, 
                    I had to turn to sources beyond what we learned in class. As just about any computer/software engineer or
                    CS major will tell you, StackOverflow is probably at the top of that list. I also reached out to friends
                    that had taken those classes, as sometimes they would be helpful in completing my work
                </p>
                <p>
                    I think that if I were to do my undergrad work again at Iowa State, I would pay more attention to what classes are required, 
                    and the sort of "dependency chain" of CPRE core classes. I spent my first four semesters out of highschool at Kirkwood 
                    Community College. While I also enjoyed that experience, I didn't realize that I would have to do the 281 -> 288 -> 381 -> 308 -> 491 -> 492
                    chain of classes, none of which were offered at Kirkwood, which meant I spent a couple extra semesters in college than I would've preferred.
