                    Through all the general education electives I’ve taken at Iowa State, I’ve learned about topics beyond those taught 
                    in my engineering courses, and these classes have taught me different ways of looking at problems, and how problem 
                    solving can go beyond your standard technical courses.

                    Some of my most enjoyable gen ed classes have been HSP M 383, 383L, and 385x. While I initially took these classes 
                    because I wanted to have a fun time trying different beverages, I actually learned a lot about the history of wine, 
                    beer, spirits, and mixed drinks. The historical development of lots of these drinks can be interesting stories of 
                    innovation and ingenuity. One such story is the creation of America’s first beer style, the California Common (sometimes called Steam Beer). 
                    When the gold rush began in 1849, thousands moved out to California in hopes to strike it rich, and even more people 
                    moved out to support the miners and make some money themselves. When some brewers went west, they brought with them 
                    yeast strains commonly used for making lagers, which ferment at refrigeration level temps. Without any sort of refrigeration, 
                    brewers improvised, using the lager yeast at warmer temperatures, and creating a new style of beer that has persisted to this day.

                    During my first semester at Iowa State, I took Econ 101, Principles of Microeconomics. While I now have no plans of ever getting an economics minor, 
                    I think that learning the basics of topics like supply & demand and opportunity costs. These have influenced how I look at engineering problems, 
                    and consider aspects outside of what I’ve learned in my more technical engineering classes.
