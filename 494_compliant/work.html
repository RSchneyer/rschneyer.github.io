                    <li><i>Aug 2020 - Present</i></li>
                    <li>I've been a tutor with Iowa State's Academic Success Center since the Fall 2020 semester. In that time, I've tutored the following classes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Digital Logic (CPRE 281)</li>
                            <li>Embedded Systems (CPRE 288)</li>
                            <li>Theoretical Foundations of Computer Engineering (CPRE 310)</li>
                            <li>Object Oriented Programming (COM S 227)</li>
                            <li>Introduction to Data Structures (COM S 228)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One of the best ways to cement your knowledge in a particular topic is to teach it to someone else. 
                        By tutoring, I've gotten a much better foundation in some of the basics of computer engineering, particularly with 
                        CPRE 281 helping my knowledge in CPRE 381 and 581.

                        At Igor, I worked on a small team to test the compatibility of 3rd party devices with Igor's PoE lighting Hardware.
                        Since the company was on the smaller side, I also worked to create and update documentation, fix existing hardware, and dozens of other smaller tasks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This was my first internship where I didn't have to write a line of code. I really enjoyed the more hands-on work, 
                        much more so than the software engineering work I'd been doing at my previous internships. I also learned that I'd like to have a 
                        job where I don't have to commute 45-50 minutes to work each way, since I lived in Ames but worked in West DSM.

                    <li>
                        During my time at Hy-Vee, I worked on the accounts payable software team. We were responsible for 
                        creating and managing a web dashboard that Hy-Vee's accountants used. This meant that my team wrote the 
                        code all the way from the mainframe that processed orders, all the way to the dashboard site. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This was around the time that I decided that high level software development was not for me.
                        While everyone on my team was a pleasure to work with, I discovered that I didn't really like working
                        with pure software.

                <h2>Junior Developer<i>(Arreya Digital Signage)</i></h2>

                    <li>
                        Working as a junior developer at Arreya was my first technical job. Since Arreya was an extremely small
                        business, I wore a lot of different hats, although my main project was to create an interactive meeting
                        room signage software. <a class="link" href="https://arreya.com/solutions/rooms/">Arreya Rooms</a> is able 
                        to connect to G Suite, so that an organization's calendar can be displayed, and meetings can be booked right from the device.

                    <li>
                        Since this was my first major technical job, I went from knowing basic HTML and CSS, to creating a fully-fledged 
                        product. I learned AngularJS for the front end, and Google Firebase for the backend. On top of the technical skills
                        I developed, I also learned that I liked working at smaller companies, compared to my previous "technical" internship
                        at Collins Aerospace (then Rockwell Collins).
