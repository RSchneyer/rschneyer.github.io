                    In both engineering and personal life, a code of ethics is an important thing to have.
                    A code of ethics defines how you approach ethical issues, and gives an individual something 
                    to follow when trying to make a good decision about an ethical issue. By defining how an 
                    organization handles ethics and ethical situations, they can come up with a solution for said 
                    issue that falls in line with their guidelines and principles.

                    While I try not to get into ethical situations, when faced with an ethical situation,
                     I try to stick to the various codes of ethics discussed in class, along with some of my
                      own personal views and ethics. I look at who would be affected by the issue and how,
                       and then try to find a solution that minimizes any sort of detriment to as many of those groups as possible, 
                       as a way to find a compromise. 
                </p>

                    In class, our group discussed 3 different issues. Firstly, we discussed the Volkswagen emissions scandal from 2015, 
                    where Volkswagen had to recall nearly half a million cars after developing software to cheat on emissions tests. Next,
                    we discussed the 1970s Ford Pinto safety issues, where it was revealed that Ford knew about dangerous issues with the 
                    Pinto's gas tank, but decided that the potential litigation fees would be cheaper than improving the design. Finally, 
                    we discussed a 2015 murder case where Amazon refused to turn over Amazon Echo audio data to the police,
                     but other smart device info was used as evidence.

                <p>
                    I think that for the most part, my ethical considerations matched up with my other classmates'. In the Canvas discussions, 
                    it seemed like we all came to the same conclusions and how to apply the differing codes of ethics to each of the different cases.

                <p>
                    I think the three virtues most relevant to the Ford Pinto case study are Integrity, Honesty, and Responsibility. 
                    I chose these three because I think that they are relevant to the case study, particularly integrity. The other virtues,
                     such as fidelity, are less relevant to the case, since Ford executives were violating the safety of their customers
